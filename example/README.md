Eventually I will get a working example up and running within this codebase. Since I need to use Craco I'm using another create-react-app install. TODO is to get this example directory working.

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the elora package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to test your package.
