# Elora - A React component library for Tailwind

Elora is a component library built in TypeScript for React developers who use Tailwind in their projects. I wanted to create something that feels as quick and easy to use as slapping together HTML elements...only with JSX elements. :D

## Prequisites

Tailwind will need to be installed for your React project. See instructions here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

## Installation

Simply run 'npm install elora' to install to your React/Tailwind project.

Note: This library is still in it's infancy. Development works, but when you try to build your React app some stylings will be stripped since I'm using string concatination and PurceCSS doesn't know it should be kept.

Workaround: I've found using these instructions when creating your React app the stylings are kept after you run your build.
https://www.oscarmarion.dev/articles/tailwind-react-cra Essentially these instructions show you how to bypass using CRACO in your config. Expect updates on this topic in the future.

## Components

The button component is available now. More to come!

## Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import Button from 'elora'

const myButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      customColor='green'
      buttonStyle='pill'
      onClick={() => alert('Bibbity bobbity boop')}
      name='EloraBtn'
    >
      <p>Click me</p>
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Button props:

**@component for the all mighty button.**

**@param {string} buttonStyle** - Optional: Choose a button style from "simple", "pill", "3d", "elevated", "disabled", or "icon". Default is set to "simple" within the component if not specified

**@param {JsxElement} children** - Optional: Put any React components you want inside your Button tag.

@example
`<Button className="styles.coolButton"> <ReallyNiceSVGIcon /> </Button>`

**@param {string} className** - Optional: Add a class onto your buttonStyle prop as you see fit. For instance the "pill" buttonStyle has a default background of blue, but you could set this to "bg-pink-600" and it would add to the class attribute, thereby replacing the blue background set with "pill". Likewise, you could simply use the customColor prop in this scenario and set it to just "pink". See customColor for more info.

@example
`<Button buttonStyle="pill" className="bg-pink-600" />`

**@param {string} classNameOverride** - Optional: Replace the default className prop with someething entirely your own either with a CSS class or a Tailwind string you've cooked up.

@example
`<Button type="bordered" classNameOverride={styles.wayBetterBorderedBtn} />`

**@param {string} customColor** - Optional: Set the primary color you want the button to have.

@example
`<Button customColor="green"><p>I am set to green.</p><Button>`

**@param {JSXElement} icon** - Optional: Pass in the JSX element you want to act as your icon for buttonStyle props set to "icon".

@example
`<Button buttonStyle="icon" icon={DownloadButtonIcon}><p>Download</p></Button>`

**@param {string} name** - Optional: Set the name attribute of the button.

**@param {function} onClick** - Optional: Set the function that should run when the user clicks the button.

**@param {string} type** - Optional: Set the button type: "button" | "submit" | "reset". Defaults to "button" if undefined.

**@param {string} value** - Optional: Set the initial value of the button.
