# Elora - A React component library for Tailwind

Elora is a component library built in TypeScript for React developers who use Tailwind in their projects. I wanted to create something that feels as quick and easy to use as slapping together HTML elements...only with JSX elements. :D

## Prequisites

Tailwind will need to be installed for your React project. See instructions here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

## Installation

Simply run 'npm install elora' to install to your React/Tailwind project.

## Components

The button component is available now. More to come!

## Usage

```tsx
import React from "react"
import
```
